/* source file for ptr11p2.c
 *
 * ptr11p2 demonstrtes the function insertEntry(). This function takes as
 * arguments a pointer to a struct entry (the listHead) and another pointer
 * to a struct entry after which the new entry is to be placed.
 *
 * Sunday July 2nd
 *   I'm very tired. There is confusion in my mind about how the linked list
 *   and insertEntry() are supposed to work together. Simplify the fisrt
 *   versions. Think about how any singly linked list would work with a
 *   function like insertEntry(). How does the book present the problem?
